# 2025 Changelog

### <a id="252"></a> ClickHouse release 25.2, 2025-02-27

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* Completely enable async_load_databases by default (even for those installations that do not upgrade `config.xml`). [#74772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74772) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Add `JSONCompactEachRowWithProgress` and `JSONCompactStringsEachRowWithProgress` formats. Continuation of [#69989](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/69989). The `JSONCompactWithNames` and `JSONCompactWithNamesAndTypes` no longer output "totals" - apparently, it was a mistake in the implementation. [#75037](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75037) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Change format_alter_operations_with_parentheses default to true to disambiguate alter commands list (see https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59532). This breaks replication with clusters prior to 24.3. If you are upgrading a cluster using older releases turn off the setting in the server config or upgrade to 24.3 first. [#75302](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75302) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Remove possibility to filter log messages using regular expressions. The implementation introduced a data race, so it has to be removed. [#75577](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75577) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).

#### New Feature
* Without manual settings, use a query-scope scheduler to trigger processors to spill out data into external storage adaptively. It's helpful to coordinate memory usage among processors, and avoid OOM. [#72728](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72728) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Add a new string comparison function `stringCompare` to compare parts of two strings. Example: `SELECT stringCompare('Saxony', 'Anglo-Saxon', 0, 6, 5) AS result` means "compare 6 bytes of strings 'Saxon' and 'Anglo-Saxon' lexicographically, starting at offset 0 in the first string, offset 5 in the second string". [#74070](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74070) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Added an ability to apply non-finished (not materialized by background process) mutations during the execution of `SELECT` queries immediately after submitting. It can be enabled by setting `apply_mutations_on_fly`. [#74877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74877) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fixed some previously unexpected cases when `toStartOfInterval` datetime arguments are negative. Done by implementing a new function called toStartOfIntervalAllowNegative, which does pretty much the same but returns only Date32/DateTime64. [#74933](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74933) ([Yarik Briukhovetskyi](https://github.com/yariks5s)).
* A new function initialQueryStartTime has been added. It returns the start time of the current query. The value is the same across all shards during a distributed query. [#75087](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75087) ([Roman Lomonosov](https://github.com/lomik)).
* Add new Database engine `DatabaseBackup` that allows to instantly attach table/database from backup. [#75725](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75725) ([Maksim Kita](https://github.com/kitaisreal)).
* Add ability to ATTACH tables without database layer (avoids UUID hack). [#75788](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75788) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Restore QPL codec which has been removed in v24.10 due to licensing issues. [#76021](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76021) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Reintroduce respect `ttl_only_drop_parts` on `materialize ttl`; only read necessary columns to recalculate TTL and drop parts by replacing them with an empty one. [#72751](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72751) ([Andrey Zvonov](https://github.com/zvonand)).
* Fixed calculation of size in memory for `LowCardinality` columns. [#74688](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74688) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Improve performance of the whole JSON column reading in Wide parts from S3. It's done by adding prefetches for subcolumn prefixes deserialization, cache of deserialized prefixes and parallel deserialization of subcolumn prefixes. It improves reading of the JSON column from S3 4 times in query like `SELECT data FROM table` and about 10 times in query like `SELECT data FROM table LIMIT 10`. [#74827](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74827) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fixed double preallocation in `ConcurrentHashJoin` in case join sides are swapped by the optimizer. [#75149](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75149) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Fixed unnecessary contention in `parallel_hash` when `max_rows_in_join = max_bytes_in_join = 0`. [#75155](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75155) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Slight improvement in some join scenarios: precalculate number of output rows and reserve memory for them. [#75376](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75376) ([Alexander Gololobov](https://github.com/davenger)).
* `plain_rewritable` metadata files are small and do not need a large default buffer. Use a write buffer sized appropriately to fit the given path, improving memory utilization for a large number of active parts. ### Documentation entry for user-facing changes. [#75758](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75758) ([Julia Kartseva](https://github.com/jkartseva)).
* It was discovered that concurrency control could lead to unfair CPU distribution between INSERTs and SELECTs. When all CPU slots are allocated unconditionally (w/o competition) to INSERTs with `max_threads` = 1 while SELECTs with high `max_threads` values suffer from poor performance due to using only a single thread. [#75941](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75941) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).

#### Improvement
* Add support for SSL authentication with named collections for MySQL. Closes [#59111](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59111). [#59452](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/59452) ([Nikolay Degterinsky](https://github.com/evillique)).
* Drop blocks as early as possible to reduce the memory requirements. [#65647](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65647) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* `processors_profile_log` table now has default configuration with TTL of 30 days. [#66139](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/66139) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* Introduce latency buckets and use them to track first byte read/write and connect times for S3 requests. That way we can later use gathered data to calculate approximate percentiles and adapt timeouts. [#69783](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69783) ([Alexey Katsman](https://github.com/alexkats)).
* Queries passed to `Executable` storage are no longer limited to single threaded execution. [#70084](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70084) ([yawnt](https://github.com/yawnt)).
* Evaluate parquet bloom filters and min/max indexes together. Necessary to properly support: `x = 3 or x > 5` where data = [1, 2, 4, 5]. [#71383](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71383) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Allow to shard names in cluster configuration. [#72276](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72276) ([MikhailBurdukov](https://github.com/MikhailBurdukov)).
* For query like, where a<b and b<c and c<5, can generate new comparing conditions (a<5 and b<5) to have better filter ability. [#73164](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73164) ([Shichao Jin](https://github.com/jsc0218)).
* Support type Nullable(JSON). [#73556](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73556) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix type mapping for SQLite (integer types into `int64`, floating points into `float64`). [#73853](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73853) ([Joanna Hulboj](https://github.com/jh0x)).
* Change prometheus remote write response success status from 200/OK to 204/NoContent. [#74170](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74170) ([Michael Dempsey](https://github.com/bluestealth)).
* Add ability to reload `max_remote_read_network_bandwidth_for_serve` and `max_remote_write_network_bandwidth_for_server` on fly without restart server. [#74206](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74206) ([Kai Zhu](https://github.com/nauu)).
* Support subcolumns in default and materialized expressions. [#74403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74403) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Added `dfs.client.use.datanode.hostname` libhdfs3 config option support. [#74635](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74635) ([Mikhail Tiukavkin](https://github.com/freshertm)).
* Allow using blob paths to calculate checksums while making a backup. [#74729](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74729) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Fetch parts in parallel in ALTER TABLE FETCH PARTITION (thread pool size is controlled with `max_fetch_partition_thread_pool_size`). [#74978](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74978) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Added a query ID column to `system.query_cache` (issue [#68205](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68205)). [#74982](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74982) ([NamHoaiNguyen](https://github.com/NamHoaiNguyen)).
* Fix formatting of exceptions using a custom format if they appear during query interpretation. In previous versions, exceptions were formatted using the default format rather than the format specified in the query. This closes [#55422](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/55422). [#74994](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74994) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* It is allowed to cancel `ALTER TABLE ... FREEZE ...` queries with `KILL QUERY` and timeout(`max_execution_time`). [#75016](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75016) ([Kirill](https://github.com/kirillgarbar)).
* Add support for `groupUniqArrayArrayMap` as `SimpleAggregateFunction`. [#75034](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75034) ([Miel Donkers](https://github.com/mdonkers)).
* Support prepared statements in postgres wire protocol. [#75035](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75035) ([scanhex12](https://github.com/scanhex12)).
* Hide catalog credential settings in database engine `Iceberg`. Closes [#74559](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74559). [#75080](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75080) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* ... Added a few missing features into BuzzHouse: `ILIKE` and `REGEXP` operators, plus <=> and `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`. [#75168](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75168) ([Pedro Ferreira](https://github.com/PedroTadim)).
* The setting `min_chunk_bytes_for_parallel_parsing` cannot be zero anymore. This fixes: [#71110](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71110). [#75239](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75239) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* `intExp2` / `intExp10`: Define undefined behaviour: return 0 for too small argument, `18446744073709551615` for too big argument, throw exception if `nan`. [#75312](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75312) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Support `s3.endpoint` natively from catalog config in `DatabaseIceberg`. Closes [#74558](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74558). [#75375](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75375) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Don't fail silently if user executing `SYSTEM DROP REPLICA` doesn't have enough permissions. [#75377](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75377) ([Bharat Nallan](https://github.com/bharatnc)).
* Add a ProfileEvent about the number of times any of system logs has failed to flush. [#75466](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75466) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add check and logging for decrypting and decompressing. [#75471](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75471) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Added support for the micro sign (U+00B5) in the `parseTimeDelta` function. Now both the micro sign (U+00B5) and the Greek letter mu (U+03BC) are recognized as valid representations for microseconds, aligning ClickHouse's behavior with Go’s implementation ([see time.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/ad7b46ee4ac1cee5095d64b01e8cf7fcda8bee5e/src/time/time.go#L983C19-L983C20) and [time/format.go](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/ad7b46ee4ac1cee5095d64b01e8cf7fcda8bee5e/src/time/format.go#L1608-L1609)). [#75472](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75472) ([Vitaly Orlov](https://github.com/orloffv)).
* Replace server setting (`send_settings_to_client`) with client setting (`apply_settings_from_server`) that controls whether client-side code (e.g. parsing INSERT data and formatting query output) should use settings from server's `users.xml` and user profile. Otherwise only settings from client command line, session, and the query are used. Note that this only applies to native client (not e.g. HTTP), and doesn't apply to most of query processing (which happens on the server). [#75478](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75478) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Keeper improvement: disable digest calculation when committing to in-memory storage for better performance. It can be enabled with `keeper_server.digest_enabled_on_commit` config. Digest is still calculated when preprocessing requests. [#75490](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75490) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Push down filter expression from JOIN ON when possible. [#75536](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75536) ([Vladimir Cherkasov](https://github.com/vdimir)).
* Better error messages at syntax errors. Previously, if the query was too large, and the token whose length exceeds the limit is a very large string literal, the message about the reason was lost in the middle of two examples of this very long token. Fix the issue when a query with UTF-8 was cut incorrectly in the error message. Fix excessive quoting of query fragments. This closes [#75473](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75473). [#75561](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75561) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add profile events in storage `S3(Azure)Queue`. [#75618](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75618) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Disable sending settings from server to client (`send_settings_to_client=false`) for compatibility (This feature will be re-implemented as client setting later for better usability). [#75648](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75648) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Add a config `memory_worker_correct_memory_tracker` to enable correction of internal memory tracker with information from different source read in the background thread periodically. [#75714](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75714) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Use Analyzer in PrometheusRemoteReadProtocol. [#75729](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75729) ([Dmitry Novik](https://github.com/novikd)).
* Add column `normalized_query_hash` into `system.processes`. Note: while it can be easily calculated on the fly with the `normalizedQueryHash` function, this is needed to prepare for subsequent changes. [#75756](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75756) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Querying `system.tables` will not throw even if there is a `Merge` table created over a database that no longer exists. Remove the `getTotalRows` method from `Hive` tables, because we don't allow it to do complex work. [#75772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75772) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Web UI now has interactive database navigation. [#75777](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75777) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Allow to combine read-only and read-write disks in storage policy (as multiple volumes, or multiple disks). This allows to read data from the entire volume, while inserts will prefer the writable disk (i.e. Copy-on-Write storage policy). [#75862](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75862) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Store start_time/end_time for Backups with microseconds. [#75929](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75929) ([Aleksandr Musorin](https://github.com/AVMusorin)).
* Add `MemoryTrackingUncorrected` metric showing value of internal global memory tracker which is not corrected by RSS. [#75935](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75935) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Calculate columns and indices sizes lazily in MergeTree. [#75938](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75938) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Allow to parse endpoints like `localhost:1234/handle` in `postgresql` or `mysql` table functions. This fixes a regression introduced in https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/52503. [#75944](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75944) ([Nikita Mikhaylov](https://github.com/nikitamikhaylov)).
* Added a server setting `throw_on_unknown_workload` that allows to choose behavior on query with `workload` setting set to unknown value: either allow unlimited access (default) or throw a `RESOURCE_ACCESS_DENIED` error. It is useful to force all queries to use workload scheduling. [#75999](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75999) ([Sergei Trifonov](https://github.com/serxa)).
* Make the new, experimental Kafka table engine fully respect Keeper feature flags. [#76004](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76004) ([János Benjamin Antal](https://github.com/antaljanosbenjamin)).
* Don't rewrite subcolumns to getSubcolumn in ARRAY JOIN if not necessary. [#76018](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76018) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Retry coordination errors when loading tables. [#76020](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76020) ([Alexander Tokmakov](https://github.com/tavplubix)).
* Support flushing individual logs in SYSTEM FLUSH LOGS. [#76132](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76132) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Improved the `/binary` server's page. Using the Hilbert curve instead of the Morton curve. Display 512 MB worth of addresses in the square, which fills the square better (in previous versions, addresses fill only half of the square). Color addresses closer to the library name rather than the function name. Allow scrolling a bit more outside of the area. [#76192](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76192) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Retry ON CLUSTER queries in case of TOO_MANY_SIMULTANEOUS_QUERIES. [#76352](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76352) ([Patrick Galbraith](https://github.com/CaptTofu)).
* Add the `CPUOverload` asynchronous metric, which calculates the relative CPU deficit of the server. [#76404](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76404) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Changed the default value of `output_format_pretty_max_rows` from 10000 to 1000. I think it is better for usability. [#76407](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76407) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)

* Fix crash when inserting interval (issue [#74299](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74299)). [#74478](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74478) ([NamHoaiNguyen](https://github.com/NamHoaiNguyen)).
* Fix formatting constant JSON literals. Previously it could lead to syntax errors during sending the query to another server. [#74533](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74533) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Fix broken create query when using constant partition expressions with implicit projections enabled. This fixes [#74596](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74596) . [#74634](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74634) ([Amos Bird](https://github.com/amosbird)).
* Avoid leaving connection in broken state after INSERT finishes with exception. [#74740](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74740) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

* Revert part's state from deleting back to outdated when remove operation has failed. [#74985](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74985) ([Sema Checherinda](https://github.com/CheSema)).
* In previous versions, when there was a scalar subquery, we started writing the progress (accumulated from processing the subquery) during the initialization of the data format, which was before HTTP headers were written. This led to the loss of HTTP headers, such as X-ClickHouse-QueryId and X-ClickHouse-Format, as well as Content-Type. [#74991](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74991) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Fix nullsafe JOIN handling for LowCardinality nullable data type. Previously JOIN ON with nullsafe comparison, such as `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM`, `<=>` , `a IS NULL AND b IS NULL OR a == b` didn't work correctly with LowCardinality columns.

* Function `TRIM` with computed empty trim characters are now correctly handled. Example: `SELECT TRIM(LEADING concat('') FROM 'foo')` (Issue [#69922](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/69922)). [#75399](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75399) ([Manish Gill](https://github.com/mgill25)).

* Respect `materialized_views_ignore_errors` when a materialized view writes to a URL engine and there is a connectivity issue. [#75679](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75679) ([Christoph Wurm](https://github.com/cwurm)).
* Fixed rare crashes while reading from `MergeTree` table after multiple asynchronous `RENAME` queries (with `alter_sync = 0`) between columns with different types. [#75693](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75693) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Fix `Block structure mismatch in QueryPipeline stream` error for some queries with `UNION ALL`. [#75715](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75715) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Rebuild projection on alter modify of its PK column. Previously it could lead to `CANNOT_READ_ALL_DATA` errors during selects after alter modify of the column used in projection PK. [#75720](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75720) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).

* Propagate format settings to JSON as string formatting in Native format. [#75832](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75832) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Recorded the default enablement of parallel hash as join algorithm in v24.12 in the settings change history. This means that ClickHouse will continue to join using non-parallel hash if an older compatibility level than v24.12 is configured. [#75870](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75870) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Fixed a bug that tables with implicitly added min-max indices could not be copied into a new table (issue [#75677](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75677)). [#75877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75877) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* `clickhouse-library-bridge` allows opening arbitrary libraries from the filesystem, which makes it safe to run only inside an isolated environment. To prevent a vulnerability when it is run near the clickhouse-server, we will limit the paths of libraries to a location, provided in the configuration. This vulnerability was found with the [ClickHouse Bug Bounty Program](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/38986) by **Arseniy Dugin**. [#75954](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75954) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* We happened to use JSON serialization for some metadata, which was a mistake, because JSON does not support binary data inside string literals, including zero bytes. SQL queries can contain binary data and invalid UTF-8, so we have to support this in our metadata files as well. At the same time, ClickHouse's `JSONEachRow` and similar formats work around that by deviating from the JSON standard in favor of a perfect roundtrip for the binary data. See the motivation here: https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73668#issuecomment-2560501790. The solution is to make `Poco::JSON` library consistent with the JSON format serialization in ClickHouse. This closes [#73668](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73668). [#75963](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75963) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Fix check for commit limits in storage `S3Queue`. [#76104](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76104) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Fix attaching MergeTree tables with auto indexes (`add_minmax_index_for_numeric_columns`/`add_minmax_index_for_string_columns`). [#76139](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76139) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Fixed issue of stack traces from parent threads of a job (`enable_job_stack_trace` setting) are not printed out. Fixed issue `enable_job_stack_trace` setting is not properly propagated to the threads resulting stack trace content not always respects this setting. [#76191](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76191) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Fix incorrect permission check where `ALTER RENAME` required `CREATE USER` grant. Closes [#74372](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/74372). [#76241](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76241) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).

* Removed allocation from the signal handler. [#76446](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76446) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).

#### Build/Testing/Packaging Improvement
* Restore deleted nats integration tests and fix errors. - fixed some race conditions in nats engine - fixed data loss when streaming data to nats in case of connection loss - fixed freeze of receiving the last chunk of data when streaming from nats ended - nats_max_reconnect is deprecated and has no effect, reconnect is performed permanently with nats_reconnect_wait timeout. [#69772](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/69772) ([Dmitry Novikov](https://github.com/dmitry-sles-novikov)).
* Support build HDFS on both ARM and Intel mac. [#74244](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74244) ([Yan Xin](https://github.com/yxheartipp)).
* Update to embedded LLVM 19. [#75148](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75148) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* *Potentially breaking*: Improvement to set even more restrictive defaults. The current defaults are already secure - the user has to specify an option to publish ports explicitly. But when the `default` user doesn’t have a password set by `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` and/or a username changed by `CLICKHOUSE_USER` environment variables, it should be available only from the local system as an additional level of protection. [#75259](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75259) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Integration tests have 1 hour timeout for single batch of parallel tests running. When this timeout is reached `pytest` is killed without some logs. Internal pytest timeout is set to 55 minutes to print results from a session and not trigger external timeout signal. Closes [#75532](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/75532). [#75533](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75533) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* Make all clickhouse-server related actions a function, and execute them only when launching the default binary in `entrypoint.sh`. A long-postponed improvement was suggested in [#50724](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/50724). Added switch `--users` to `clickhouse-extract-from-config` to get values from the `users.xml`. [#75643](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75643) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* For stress tests if server did not exit while we collected stacktraces via gdb additional wait time is added to make `Possible deadlock on shutdown (see gdb.log)` detection less noisy. It will only add delay for cases when test did not finish successfully. [#75668](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75668) ([Ilya Yatsishin](https://github.com/qoega)).
* Enable ICU and GRPC when cross-compiling for Darwin. [#75922](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/75922) ([Raúl Marín](https://github.com/Algunenano)).
* Fixing splitting test's output because of `sleep` during the process group killing. [#76090](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76090) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Do not collect the `docker-compose` logs at the end of running since the script is often killed. Instead, collect them in the background. [#76140](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76140) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Split tests for kafka storage into a few files. Fixes [#69452](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/69452). [#76208](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76208) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Remove about 20MB of dead code from the binary. [#76226](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76226) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The long time outdated `pytest-random` is replaced by `pytest-random-order`. Enable `random-order` for flaky tests. Fix `test_dns_cache_update`. [#76233](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76233) ([Mikhail f. Shiryaev](https://github.com/Felixoid)).
* Raise minimum required CMake version to 3.25 due to `block()` introduction. [#76316](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76316) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Bump `lz4` to `1.10.0`. [#76571](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76571) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Bump `curl` to `8.12.1`. [#76572](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/76572) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).

### <a id="251"></a> ClickHouse release 25.1, 2025-01-28

#### Backward Incompatible Change
* `JSONEachRowWithProgress` will write the progress whenever the progress happens. In previous versions, the progress was shown only after each block of the result, which made it useless. Change the way how the progress is displayed: it will not show zero values. This closes [#70800](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70800). [#73834](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73834) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* `Merge` tables will unify the structure of underlying tables by using a union of their columns and deriving common types. This closes [#64864](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64864). In certain cases, this change could be backward incompatible. One example is when there is no common type between tables, but conversion to the type of the first table is still possible, such as in the case of UInt64 and Int64 or any numeric type and String. If you want to return to the old behavior, set `merge_table_max_tables_to_look_for_schema_inference` to `1` or set `compatibility` to `24.12` or earlier. [#73956](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73956) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Parquet output format converts Date and DateTime columns to date/time types supported by Parquet, instead of writing them as raw numbers. `DateTime` becomes `DateTime64(3)` (was: `UInt32`); setting `output_format_parquet_datetime_as_uint32` brings back the old behavior. `Date` becomes `Date32` (was: `UInt16`). [#70950](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70950) ([Michael Kolupaev](https://github.com/al13n321)).
* Don't allow not comparable types (like `JSON`/`Object`/`AggregateFunction`) in `ORDER BY` and comparison functions `less/greater/equal/etc` by default. [#73276](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73276) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* The obsolete `MaterializedMySQL` database engine has been removed and is no longer available. [#73879](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73879) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The `mysql` dictionary source no longer does `SHOW TABLE STATUS` query, because it does not provide any value for InnoDB tables, as long as for any recent MySQL versions. This closes [#72636](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72636). This change is backward compatible, but put in this category so you have a chance to notice it. [#73914](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73914) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* `CHECK TABLE` queries now require a separate, `CHECK` grant. In previous versions, it was enough to have `SHOW TABLES` grant to run these queries. But a `CHECK TABLE` query can be heavy, and usual query complexity limits for `SELECT` queries don't apply to it. It led to the potential of DoS. [#74471](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74471) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Function `h3ToGeo()` now returns the results in the order `(lat, lon)` (which is the standard order for geometric functions). Users who wish to retain the legacy result order `(lon, lat)` can set setting `h3togeo_lon_lat_result_order = true`. [#74719](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74719) ([Manish Gill](https://github.com/mgill25)).
* A new MongoDB driver is now the default. Users who like to continue using the legacy driver can set server setting `use_legacy_mongodb_integration` to true. [#73359](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73359) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).

#### New Feature
* Added an ability to apply non-finished (not materialized by background process) mutations during the execution of `SELECT` queries immediately after submitting. It can be enabled by setting `apply_mutations_on_fly`. [#74877](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74877) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Implement `Iceberg` tables partition pruning for time-related transform partition operations in Iceberg. [#72044](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72044) ([Daniil Ivanik](https://github.com/divanik)).
* Support subcolumns in MergeTree sorting key and skip indexes. [#72644](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72644) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Support reading `HALF_FLOAT` values from `Apache Arrow`/`Parquet`/`ORC` (they are read into `Float32`). This closes [#72960](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72960). Keep in mind that IEEE-754 half float is not the same as `BFloat16`. Closes [#73835](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73835). [#73836](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73836) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* The `system.trace_log` table will contain two new columns, `symbols` and `lines` containing symbolized stack trace. It allows for easy collection and export of profile information. This is controlled by the server configuration value `symbolize` inside `trace_log` and is enabled by default. [#73896](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73896) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add a new function, `generateSerialID`, which can be used to generate auto-incremental numbers in tables. Continuation of [#64310](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64310) by [kazalika](https://github.com/kazalika). This closes [#62485](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/62485). [#73950](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73950) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add syntax `query1 PARALLEL WITH query2 PARALLEL WITH query3 ... PARALLEL WITH queryN` for DDL queries. That means subqueries `{query1, query2, ... queryN}` are allowed to run in parallel with each other (and it's preferable). [#73983](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73983) ([Vitaly Baranov](https://github.com/vitlibar)).
* Added an in-memory cache for deserialized skipping index granules. This should make repeated queries that use skipping indexes faster. The size of the new cache is controlled by server settings `skipping_index_cache_size` and `skipping_index_cache_max_entries`. The original motivation for the cache were vector similarity indexes which became a lot faster now. [#70102](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/70102) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Now, the embedded Web UI has a progress bar during query runtime. It allows cancelling queries. It displays the total number of records and the extended information about the speed. The table can be rendered incrementally as soon as data arrives. Enable HTTP compression. Rendering of the table became faster. The table header became sticky. It allows selecting cells and navigating them by arrow keys. Fix the issue when the outline of the selected cell makes it smaller. Cells no longer expand on mouse hover but only on selection. The moment to stop rendering the incoming data is decided on the client rather than on the server side. Highlight digit groups for numbers. The overall design was refreshed and became bolder. It checks if the server is reachable and the correctness of credentials and displays the server version and uptime. The cloud icon is contoured in every font, even in Safari. Big integers inside nested data types will be rendered better. It will display inf/nan correctly. It will display data types when the mouse is over a column header. [#74204](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74204) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add the ability to create min-max (skipping) indices by default for columns managed by MergeTree using settings `add_minmax_index_for_numeric_columns` (for numeric columns) and `add_minmax_index_for_string_columns` (for string columns). For now, both settings are disabled, so there is no behavior change yet. [#74266](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74266) ([Smita Kulkarni](https://github.com/SmitaRKulkarni)).
* Add `script_query_number` and `script_line_number` fields to `system.query_log`, to the ClientInfo in the native protocol, and to server logs. This closes [#67542](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/67542). Credits to [pinsvin00](https://github.com/pinsvin00) for kicking off this feature earlier in [#68133](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/68133). [#74477](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74477) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Added aggregation function `sequenceMatchEvents` which return timestamps of matched events for longest chain of events in pattern. [#72349](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72349) ([UnamedRus](https://github.com/UnamedRus)).
* Added function `arrayNormalizedGini`. [#72823](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72823) ([flynn](https://github.com/ucasfl)).
* Add minus operator support for `DateTime64`, to allow subtraction between `DateTime64` values, as well as `DateTime`. [#74482](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74482) ([Li Yin](https://github.com/liyinsg)).

#### Experimental Features
* The `BFloat16` data type is production-ready. [#73840](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73840) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

#### Performance Improvement
* Optimized function `indexHint`. Now, columns that are only used as arguments of function `indexHint` are not read from the table. [#74314](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74314) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)). If the `indexHint` function is a central piece of your enterprise data architecture, this optimization will save your life.
* More accurate accounting for `max_joined_block_size_rows` setting for `parallel_hash` JOIN algorithm. Helps to avoid increased memory consumption compared to `hash` algorithm. [#74630](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74630) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Support predicate push down optimization on the query plan level for the `MergingAggregated` step. It improves performance for some queries with the analyzer. [#74073](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74073) ([Nikolai Kochetov](https://github.com/KochetovNicolai)).
* Splitting of left table blocks by hash was removed from the probe phase of the `parallel_hash` JOIN algorithm. [#73089](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73089) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Optimize RowBinary input format. Closes [#63805](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/63805). [#65059](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65059) ([Pavel Kruglov](https://github.com/Avogar)).
* Write parts with level 1 if `optimize_on_insert` is enabled. It allows to use several optimizations of queries with `FINAL` for freshly written parts. [#73132](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73132) ([Anton Popov](https://github.com/CurtizJ)).
* Speedup string deserialization by some low-level optimisation. [#65948](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/65948) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* When running an equality comparison between records, such as during merges, start to compare rows from most likely unequal columns first. [#63780](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/63780) ([UnamedRus](https://github.com/UnamedRus)).
* Improve grace hash join performance by re-ranking the right join table by keys. [#72237](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72237) ([kevinyhzou](https://github.com/KevinyhZou)).
* Allow `arrayROCAUC` and `arrayAUCPR` to compute partial area of the whole curve, so that its calculation can be parallelized over huge datasets. [#72904](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72904) ([Emmanuel](https://github.com/emmanuelsdias)).
* Avoid spawn too many idle threads. [#72920](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72920) ([Guo Wangyang](https://github.com/guowangy)).
* Don't list blob storage keys if we only have curly brackets expansion in table function. Closes [#73333](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/73333). [#73518](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73518) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Short circuit optimization for functions executed over Nullable arguments. [#73820](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73820) ([李扬](https://github.com/taiyang-li)).
* Do not apply `maskedExecute` on non-function columns, improve the performance of short circuit execution. [#73965](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73965) ([lgbo](https://github.com/lgbo-ustc)).
* Disable the autodetection of headers in input formats for `Kafka`/`NATS`/`RabbitMQ`/`FileLog` to improve performance. [#74006](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74006) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).
* Execute pipeline with a higher degree of parallelism after aggregation with grouping sets. [#74082](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74082) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* Reduce critical section in `MergeTreeReadPool`. [#74202](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74202) ([Guo Wangyang](https://github.com/guowangy)).
* Parallel replicas performance improvement. Packets deserialization on query initiator, for packets not related to parallel replicas protocol, now always happens in pipeline thread. Before, it could happen in a thread responsible for pipeline scheduling, which could make initiator less responsive and delay pipeline execution. [#74398](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74398) ([Igor Nikonov](https://github.com/devcrafter)).
* Improve performance of larger multi requests in Keeper. [#74849](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74849) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* Use log wrappers by value and don't allocate them in a heap. [#74034](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74034) ([Mikhail Artemenko](https://github.com/Michicosun)).
* Reestablish connection to MySQL and Postgres dictionary replicas in the background, so it wouldn't delay requests to corresponding dictionaries. [#71101](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71101) ([Yakov Olkhovskiy](https://github.com/yakov-olkhovskiy)).
* Parallel replicas used historical information about replica availability to improve replica selection but did not update the replica's error count when the connection was unavailable. This PR updates the replica's error count when unavailable. [#72666](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72666) ([zoomxi](https://github.com/zoomxi)).
* Added a merge tree setting `materialize_skip_indexes_on_merge` which suppresses the creation of skip indexes during merge. This allows users to control explicitly (via `ALTER TABLE [..] MATERIALIZE INDEX [...]`) when skip indexes are created. This can be useful if skip indexes are expensive to build (e.g. vector similarity indexes). [#74401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74401) ([Robert Schulze](https://github.com/rschu1ze)).
* Optimize keeper requests in Storage(S3/Azure)Queue. [#74410](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74410) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)). [#74538](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74538) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).
* Use up to `1000` parallel replicas by default. [#74504](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74504) ([Konstantin Bogdanov](https://github.com/thevar1able)).
* Improve HTTP session reuse when reading from s3 disk ([#72401](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72401)). [#74548](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74548) ([Julian Maicher](https://github.com/jmaicher)).

[#73833](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73833) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Highlight trailing spaces in Pretty and Vertical formats in the terminal for better clarity. This is controlled with the `output_format_pretty_highlight_trailing_spaces` setting. Initial implementation by [Braden Burns](https://github.com/bradenburns) from [#72996](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/72996). Closes [#71590](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/71590). [#73847](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73847) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

[#73848](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73848) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Cut too long column names in pretty formats by default. This is controlled by the `output_format_pretty_max_column_name_width_cut_to` and `output_format_pretty_max_column_name_width_min_chars_to_cut` settings. This is the continuation of the work of [tanmaydatta](https://github.com/tanmaydatta) in [#66502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/66502). This closes [#65968](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65968). [#73851](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73851) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Make `Pretty` formats prettier: squash blocks if not much time passed since the output of the previous block. This is controlled by new settings `output_format_pretty_squash_consecutive_ms` (50 ms by default) and `output_format_pretty_squash_max_wait_ms` (1000 ms by default). Continuation of [#49537](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49537). This closes [#49153](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/49153). [#73852](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73852) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Add a metric on the number of currently merging source parts. This closes [#70809](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/70809). [#73868](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73868) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Highlight columns in the `Vertical` format if the output is to a terminal. This can be disabled with the `output_format_pretty_color` setting. [#73898](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73898) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Enhanced the MySQL compatibility to a level that now, `mysqlsh` (a rich MySQL CLI from Oracle) can connect to ClickHouse. This is needed to facilitate testing. [#73912](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73912) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Pretty formats can render multi-line fields inside a table cell, which improves readability. This is enabled by default and can be controlled by the setting `output_format_pretty_multiline_fields`. Continuation of the work by [Volodyachan](https://github.com/Volodyachan) in [#64094](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64094).

* The `JSONEachRowWithProgress` format will include events with metadata, as well as totals and extremes. It also includes `rows_before_limit_at_least` and `rows_before_aggregation`. The format prints the exception properly if it arrives after partial results. The progress now includes elapsed nanoseconds. One final progress event is emitted at the end. The progress during query runtime will be printed no more frequently than the value of the `interactive_delay` setting. [#74181](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74181) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Hourglass will rotate smoothly in Play UI. [#74182](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74182) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* If the number of output records is larger than N = `output_format_pretty_max_rows`, instead of displaying only the first N rows, we will cut the output table in the middle, displaying N/2 first rows and N/2 last rows. Continuation of [#64200](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/64200). This closes [#59502](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/59502). [#73929](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73929) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).

* Historically for some reason, the query `ALTER TABLE MOVE PARTITION TO TABLE` checked `SELECT` and `ALTER DELETE` rights instead of dedicated `ALTER_MOVE_PARTITION`. This PR makes use of this access type. For compatibility, this permission is also will be granted implicitly if `SELECT` and `ALTER DELETE` are granted, but this behavior will be removed in future releases. Closes [#16403](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/16403). [#71632](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/71632) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).

* Use Keeper multi requests in the cleanup thread of ObjectStorageQueueMetadata. [#73357](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73357) ([Antonio Andelic](https://github.com/antonio2368)).
* When ClickHouse runs under a cgroup we will still collect system-wide asynchronous metrics related to system load, process scheduling, memory etc. They might provide useful signals when ClickHouse is the only process on the host with high resource consumption. [#73369](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73369) ([Nikita Taranov](https://github.com/nickitat)).
* In storage `S3Queue` allow to transfer old ordered tables created before 24.6 to new structure with buckets. [#73467](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73467) ([Kseniia Sumarokova](https://github.com/kssenii)).

* The function `isIPv4String` returned true if the correct IPv4 address was followed by a zero byte, while it should return false in this case. Continuation of [#65387](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/65387). [#73946](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/73946) ([Alexey Milovidov](https://github.com/alexey-milovidov)).
* Make the error code in the MySQL wire protocol compatible with MySQL. Continuation of [#56831](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/issues/56831).

* Now users can be specified inside the startup scripts. [#74894](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74894) ([pufit](https://github.com/pufit)).
* Add support for Azure SAS Tokens. [#72959](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/72959) ([Azat Khuzhin](https://github.com/azat)).

#### Bug Fix (user-visible misbehavior in an official stable release)
* Set parquet compression level only if compression codec supports it. [#74659](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/pull/74659) ([Arthur Passos](https://github.com/arthurpassos)).
* Fixed a regression that using collation locales with modifiers throws an error.
