# ClickHouse SQL Reference

ClickHouse supports a familiar declarative query language based on SQL that is identical to the ANSI SQL standard in many cases, but offers a host of additional functionality.

The SQL reference page serves as a comprehensive guide to help users understand and make use of ClickHouse's query language and functionality. It contains information about the supported syntax,
data types, statements and wide range of input and output formats supported in ClickHouse as well as information on database and table engines and a large number of functions that
make ClickHouse such an efficient and versatile tool.
