AES_128_GCM_SIV	0	0	1	0	0	0	Encrypts and decrypts blocks with AES-128 in GCM-SIV mode (RFC-8452).
DoubleDelta	1	0	0	0	1	0	Stores difference between neighboring delta values; suitable for time series data.
T64	1	0	0	0	0	0	Preprocessor. Crops unused high bits; puts them into a 64x64 bit matrix; optimized for 64-bit data types.
Delta	0	0	0	0	1	0	Preprocessor (should be followed by some compression codec). Stores difference between neighboring values; good for monotonically increasing data.
ZSTD	1	1	0	0	0	0	Good compression; pretty fast; best for high compression needs. Don’t use levels higher than 3.
GCD	0	0	0	0	0	0	Preprocessor. Greatest common divisor compression; divides values by a common divisor; effective for divisible integer sequences.
DEFLATE_QPL	1	1	0	0	0	0	Requires hardware support for Intel’s QuickAssist Technology for DEFLATE compression; enhanced performance for specific hardware.
ZSTD_QAT	1	1	0	0	0	0	Requires hardware support for QuickAssist Technology (QAT) hardware; provides accelerated compression tasks.
LZ4HC	1	1	0	0	0	0	LZ4 High Compression algorithm with configurable level; slower but better compression than LZ4, but decompression is still fast.
FPC	1	0	0	1	0	0	High Throughput Compression of Double-Precision Floating-Point Data.
AES_256_GCM_SIV	0	0	1	0	0	0	Encrypts and decrypts blocks with AES-128 in GCM-SIV mode (RFC-8452).
LZ4	1	1	0	0	0	0	Extremely fast; good compression; balanced speed and efficiency.
Gorilla	1	0	0	1	0	0	Calculates XOR between current and previous value; suitable for slowly changing numbers.
Multiple	0	0	0	0	0	0	Apply multiple codecs consecutively defined by user.
NONE	0	0	0	0	0	0	No compression at all. Can be used on the columns that can not be compressed anyway.
